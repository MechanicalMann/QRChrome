# QRChrome
QRChrome is a very basic Chrome extension that generates QR codes from selected text, link and media URLs, and page URLs.  It runs entirely in the browser with no calls to external APIs.

## QRCode.js
This extension is basically a thin wrapper around [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) by davidshimjs.  It's super-fast and cross-browser compatible.
